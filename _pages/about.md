I'm an Assistant Professor in the [Department of English Language and Literature](https://eng.hkbu.edu.hk/academic-staff/dr-li-ran/) at Hong Kong Baptist University. Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Fellow in the [Speech, Language and Reading Lab](https://slrlab.edu.hku.hk/) at The University of Hong Kong. I obtained my PhD from the Department of Speech, Language, and Hearing Sciences at Boston University, where I worked with [Swathi Kiran](https://www.bu.edu/sargent/profile/swathi-kiran-ph-d-ccc-slp/). I got my BA in Linguistics and MA in Speech-Language Pathology at University of Maryland.

Research
======
My primary interest is to understand the mechanisms underlying aphasia recovery in Chinese-speakers with post-stroke aphasia. I have been conducting treatment studies to establish the effectiveness of different types of aphasia therapy in Mandarin-English bilinguals with aphasia.

I'm also fascinated about how the damaged brain can reorganize as a result of behavioral language therapy. I have been using fMRI as a tool to study the neural patterns associated with semantic processing in individuals with post-stroke aphasia.

Currently, my research is centered around three goals. First, to establish treatment effect of language therapy in both acute and chronic post-stroke aphasia. Second, to understand cross-linguistic differences in patterns of aphasia recovery across patients speaking English, Korean, Spanish, and Chinese. Third, to uncover the mechanisms associated with language learning across children and adults with language disorders, including dyslexia and aphasia.
