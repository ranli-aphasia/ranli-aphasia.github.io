Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Fellow in the [Speech, Language and Reading Lab](https://slrlab.edu.hku.hk/) at The University of Hong Kong. I obtained my PhD from the Department of Speech, Language, and Hearing Sciences at Boston University, where I worked with [Swathi Kiran](https://www.bu.edu/sargent/profile/swathi-kiran-ph-d-ccc-slp/). I got my BA in Linguistics and MA in Speech-Language Pathology at University of Maryland.

Ongoing Research
======
1. <b>Treatment effect of Verb Network Strengthening Treatment on Chinese-speaking individuals with aphasia</b>. We use fMRI to examine structural and functional changes following [VNeST](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09602011.2020.1773278).

2. <b>Cross-linguistic comparisons of language recovery in individuals with aphasia</b>. This work compares patterns of language recovery in terms of naming and morphosyntactic processing across aphasic patients speaking English, Korean, Spanish, Chinese, and other languages. This work is led by [Prof. Jee Eun Sung](https://www.nablesung.com/) at Ewha Womans University.

3. <b>Effect of naming treatment in acute post-stroke aphasia</b>. This is a collaborative work with [Prof. Gangyi Feng](https://ling.cuhk.edu.hk/people/faculty-linguistics/feng-gangyi/) and [Prof. Patrick Wong](https://ling.cuhk.edu.hk/patrickwong.php) at The Chinese University of Hong Kong.

4. <b>Language learning across the lifespan</b>. This work aims to examine mechanisms of language learning in both children and adults with language disorders, including dyslexia and aphasia.
