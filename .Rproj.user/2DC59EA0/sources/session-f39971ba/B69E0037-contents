I'm an Assitant Professor in the Academy of Language Culture (previously Department of English Language and Literature) at Hong Kong Baptist University. I obtained my Ph.D. from the Department of Speech, Language, and Hearing Sciences at Boston University, where I worked with [Swathi Kiran](https://www.bu.edu/sargent/profile/swathi-kiran-ph-d-ccc-slp/). I got my B.A. in Linguistics and M.A. in Speech-Language Pathology at University of Maryland.

This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [Academic Pages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the respository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. You can fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads! An older version of this template powers my own personal website at [stuartgeiger.com](http://stuartgeiger.com), which uses [this Github repository](https://github.com/staeiou/staeiou.github.io).

Research
======
I'm passionate to discover effective ways to improve language and cognitive functions in  people with post-stroke aphasia. I have previously examined treatment effects of several naming therapies, e.g., [Semantic Feature Analysis](https://pubs.asha.org/doi/abs/10.1044/2023_AJSLP-22-00236), [Verb Network Strengthening Treatment](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09602011.2020.1773278) in Mandarin-English bilinguals with aphasia.

I'm fascinated by the human brain, and how it can change after behavioral treatment. I have done an [fMRI multi-voxel pattern analysis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0028393221001445) to examine the neural correlates of language. My current research aims to use neuroimaging tools, e.g., fMRI, fNIRS, to capture functional changes following language therapy in people with aphasia.
