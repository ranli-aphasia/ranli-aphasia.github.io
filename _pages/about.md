I'm an Assistant Professor in the [Academy of Language Culture](https://eng.hkbu.edu.hk/academic-staff/dr-li-ran/) (previously Department of English Language and Literature) at Hong Kong Baptist University. I obtained my PhD from the Department of Speech, Language, and Hearing Sciences at Boston University, where I worked with [Swathi Kiran](https://www.bu.edu/sargent/profile/swathi-kiran-ph-d-ccc-slp/). I got my BA in Linguistics and MA in Speech-Language Pathology at University of Maryland.

Research
======
I'm passionate to discover effective ways to improve language and cognitive functions in  people with post-stroke aphasia. I have previously examined treatment effects of several naming therapies, e.g., [Semantic Feature Analysis](https://pubs.asha.org/doi/abs/10.1044/2023_AJSLP-22-00236), [Verb Network Strengthening Treatment](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09602011.2020.1773278) in Mandarin-English bilinguals with aphasia.

I'm fascinated by the human brain, and how it can change after behavioral treatment. I have done an [fMRI multi-voxel pattern analysis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0028393221001445) to examine the neural correlates of language. My current research aims to use neuroimaging tools, e.g., fMRI, fNIRS, to capture functional changes following language therapy in people with aphasia.
